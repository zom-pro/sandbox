This repository contains snippets of code and experiments that are not big enough to justify a repository on its own.
Also, you can find articles about these snippets in my blog:

## index

 1. python
 - my_collections: a couple of snippets using defaultdict and deque.
 - property: getter setters (kind of java style, for people coming from there) and the property decorator
